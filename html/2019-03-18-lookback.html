<!-- I will use English cause it make me not that unconfortable to express myself -->

<p>It has been one year since i start trying things other than study, so many high and lows during these time.</p>
<p>Each time a new thing came to me ,I just can't help get to it,but as I get the basis ,I just confused about what to do ,and at the time I will looking for a new thing and drop into it ,and then again go back to the loop.</p>
<p>My requirements is getting higher ,while my ablity growing slowly . And , my thoughts sometimes(most of the time) being extramalization. I just don't want to make choices. I don't want to accept one thing that easy, and don't want to drop one thing that easy. I just can't find a balanced point ,or I don't want to.</p>
